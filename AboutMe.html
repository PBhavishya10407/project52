        <h3><br>
            We want to help people to make their photos available to the people who matter to them. we want to enable new ways of organizing photos and video.
            
            Maybe they want to keep a blog of moments captured on their cameraphone, or maybe they want
            to show off their best pictures or video to the whole world in a bid for web celebrity. Or maybe they
            want to securely and privately share photos of their kids with their family across the country. Flickr
            makes all these things possible and more!
